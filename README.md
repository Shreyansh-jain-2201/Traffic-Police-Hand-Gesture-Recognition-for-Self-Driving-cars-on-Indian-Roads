## Overview

This project aims to develop a system that enables self-driving cars to recognize and interpret traffic police hand gestures on Indian roads. The system utilizes computer vision techniques, MoveNet's Thunder pose estimation model, and machine learning algorithms to detect and classify hand gestures made by traffic police officers.
